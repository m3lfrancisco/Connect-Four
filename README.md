## Description

**Connect Four** (also known as **Four Up**, **Plot Four**, **Find Four**, **Four in a Row**, and **Drop Four**) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row, vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's tokens. The game was first sold under the *Connect Four* trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.

## Getting Started

<a href="https://connectfourmyf.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Play the Game!</a>

To start the game, click any of the rectangles on the top of the board. Yellow goes first, then red. The first player to get four of their tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins! If you want to play again, just click the play again button located on the bottom of the board. You can play as many times as you want, and as long as you don't close your browser, the app keeps track of your scores. Also there is a toggle switch if you want some background music while you play.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add sound and special effects.

- [ ] Have a single player option by adding an AI.

- [X] Add background music with a toggle on/off switch.
